- Government Model
- Power Distribution
- Origins of the Political Ideas in the  Paris Commune

The **governing model of the Paris Commune** (1871) was radically democratic and became a powerful symbol for Marxists, anarchists, and socialists alike. Though it lasted only about two months (March 18 – May 28), its structure represented a unique experiment in **working-class self-government**.

Here’s a breakdown of its **governing features**:

🏛️ Structure of the Commune

1. **The Commune Council**

- Elected by **universal male suffrage** from each arrondissement (district) of Paris.
- Functioned both as a **legislative and executive body**.- Council members were **recallable at any time** and paid **workers’ wages**, not elite salaries — to prevent career politicians and promote accountability.

2. **Direct Democracy & Mandated Delegates**

- Officials were not representatives in the modern sense, but **delegates** with **binding mandates** from their constituencies.
- This meant that if a delegate didn’t follow the will of those who elected them, they could be **recalled immediately**.

🔧 Administrative and Social Reforms

The Commune introduced numerous progressive reforms:

- **Separation of Church and State**
- **Abolition of conscription and standing army**, replaced by a **people’s militia** where all citizens could participate.
- **Worker self-management**: Factories abandoned by owners were to be handed over to workers’ cooperatives.
- **Education reform**: Free, secular schooling.
- **Moratorium on debts and rents** during the siege of Paris.

🔥 Decentralization & Anti-Bureaucracy

- The Commune aimed to **abolish the centralized bureaucratic state**.
- Emphasized **federation of communes** across France (and internationally), not a centralized nation-state.
- Karl Marx noted this as an attempt to “**smash the state machine**,” replacing it with a **self-governing democracy**.

🛡️ Defense and Collapse

- The **National Guard** (comprised mostly of workers) was both the military and police force of the Commune.
- The **French government in Versailles** considered the Commune an existential threat and crushed it in what became known as **"La Semaine Sanglante" (The Bloody Week)**.

📚 Historical Legacy

- **Marx** praised it as the “**political form at last discovered**” for the emancipation of the working class.
- **Lenin** drew heavily from it in *State and Revolution*.
- **Anarchists** (like **Bakunin** and **Kropotkin**) saw it as a model of decentralized, federated, anti-statist governance.
