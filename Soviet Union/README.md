How Should I Approach the study of the Soviet Union?

- Treating the Soviet Union as a rigid “system” is of limited analytical value. A more productive approach is to see it as a dynamic social reality: a network of actors and institutions embedded in an evolving environment, producing patterns over time, but never fully reducible to a static diagram.
- Which entities?
- Which are the sphere of interest? Which are the systems of interest?
- Which data?
- How to model the political sphere?
- How to model the economic sphere? How to  model the soviet firm? Which was the economic structure of the union? How R&D Works in the Soviet Union? How basic research works? How many research institutes were there?
- How to model the human educational formation mechanisms? Was there any technical formation?
- How model the Society?
- How to model the Government? How to environment? How to model the party? How to model the beurocracy?
